Icon theme based completely on symbolic links to Numix and Paper themes.  
The theme can be regenerated by **`numix-paper-icon-theme-sh`**, or modify the script to add others icons.

The theme contains:
  * Folder icons: grey icons from Numix (instead of yellow).
  * Panel icons: panel icons from Paper.
  * Apps icons: apps icons from Paper.
  * Rest come from Numix theme.
  
## Install
Unzip `numix-paper-icon-theme.tgz` in `/usr/share/icons/` or `~/.icons`.  
Original Numix and Paper themes should be installed in `../Numix` and `../Paper`.   You can install them from packages `numix-icon-theme` and `paper-icon-theme`.  
`generate-numix-paper-icon-theme.sh` can be called for regenerate links, but not is necessary.
